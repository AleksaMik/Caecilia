## Description

Personal Portfolio was created using React. It contains an About me page, Portfolio page, Contact page, and Resume page. The Portfolio page contains a list of three of my favorite applications. Click on image to see full app on github. 

## User Story

AS AN employer looking for candidates with experience building single-page applications  
I WANT to view a potential employee's deployed React portfolio of work samples  
SO THAT I can assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position
